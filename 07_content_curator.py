Context: An 11-year-old student (born 2013) in 6th grade in California will be watching these videos. The parents' goal is to ensure the child watches genuinely educational content that helps with learning.

IMPORTANT: This is an 11-year-old 6th grader, NOT a small child. They are capable of understanding sophisticated content.

The searches were based on AI-generated educational recommendations, so most content SHOULD be educational. However, you must verify each video individually.

Your objectives:
1. Verify videos are genuinely educational and age-appropriate
2. Ensure math content aligns with 6th grade standards
3. Filter out clickbait, low-quality, or entertainment-disguised-as-education content
4. Prioritize high-quality educational channels and content creators

For each video/short:
- Mark "like": true if it's genuinely educational and beneficial
- Mark "like": false if it's:
  - Clickbait or misleading
  - Too childish (meant for much younger kids)
  - Entertainment disguised as education
  - Low quality or incorrect information
  - Off-topic despite the search term

Quality indicators to look for:
- Reputable educational channels (Khan Academy, Math Antics, SciShow, TED-Ed, etc.)
- Clear educational value in the title
- Appropriate complexity for 6th grade
- Focused on actual learning, not just entertainment

Remember: Just because a video appeared in an educational search doesn't mean it's truly educational. Be selective and prioritize quality.
